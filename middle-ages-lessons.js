  'The fall of Rome and the Byzantine Empire': {
    idea: '<p>By the 400s the Western Roman Empire was worn down by civil wars, money troubles and Germanic peoples settling inside its borders. In <b>476</b> the general <b>Odoacer</b> removed the last Western emperor, a boy called Romulus Augustulus. That date is the usual start of the <b>Middle Ages</b>, which run to about 1500.</p><p>The Eastern half carried on as the <b>Byzantine Empire</b>, ruled from <b>Constantinople</b>. Its emperor <b>Justinian</b> gathered Roman law into one code and built the great church of the <b>Hagia Sophia</b> (finished 537). It lasted until 1453.</p>',
    how: ['Split the empire in two: the West fell in 476, the East lasted to 1453.', 'Tie each name to one thing: Odoacer ended the West, Justinian made the law code and the Hagia Sophia.', 'Remember why the East lasted: richer cities and Constantinople’s walls and seas.'],
    facts: ['476: the last Western Roman emperor is deposed.', '537: the Hagia Sophia is finished.', 'Byzantine capital: Constantinople (today Istanbul).'],
    watch: ['Thinking all of Rome fell in 476: the Eastern Empire went on for almost 1,000 years.', 'Mixing up Constantine (who founded Constantinople, in the 300s) with Justinian (the 500s).'],
    tip: 'Ask yourself whether the question is about the West, which fell first, or the East, which lasted almost 1,000 years longer.',
  },
  'The Franks and Charlemagne': {
    idea: '<p>Of the kingdoms that took the West’s place, the <b>Franks</b> grew strongest. In <b>732</b> <b>Charles Martel</b> stopped an Umayyad army at the <b>Battle of Tours</b>. His grandson <b>Charlemagne</b> conquered much of western Europe, and on Christmas Day <b>800</b> <b>Pope Leo III</b> crowned him emperor.</p><p>Charlemagne brought scholars to his court and set up schools, the <b>Carolingian Renaissance</b>. After him the empire was split among his three grandsons by the <b>Treaty of Verdun</b> (<b>843</b>), into lands that grew into France and Germany.</p>',
    how: ['Line up the three generations: Charles Martel (Tours, 732), then Charlemagne (crowned 800), then his grandsons (Verdun, 843).', 'Remember who crowned whom: the pope crowned Charlemagne.', 'Link Verdun to “split in three”.'],
    facts: ['732: Battle of Tours.', '800: Charlemagne crowned emperor by Pope Leo III.', '843: Treaty of Verdun.'],
    watch: ['Mixing up Charles Martel and Charlemagne: Martel won at Tours, Charlemagne was his grandson.', 'Thinking Charlemagne was a king of France: he was king of the Franks, whose lands spread far wider.'],
    tip: 'Put it in the Frankish family order, grandfather, Charlemagne, then his grandsons: which generation is the question about?',
  },
  'The rise of Islam': {
    idea: '<p>The Prophet <b>Muhammad</b> was born in <b>Mecca</b> around 570. In <b>622</b> he and his followers moved to <b>Medina</b>, the <b>Hijra</b>, where the Islamic calendar begins. Within a century Muslim rule stretched from Spain to Central Asia, under caliphs.</p><p>The <b>Umayyads</b> ruled from Damascus, then the <b>Abbasids</b> founded <b>Baghdad</b> (<b>762</b>). Its <b>House of Wisdom</b> translated Greek, Persian and Indian works, and the digits <b>0 to 9</b> reached Europe from India through Arabic scholars.</p>',
    how: ['Place the two cities of Muhammad’s life: born in Mecca, moved to Medina in 622.', 'Tell the caliphates apart by their capital: Umayyads in Damascus, Abbasids in Baghdad.', 'Remember the learning: the House of Wisdom, and the Hindu–Arabic numerals.'],
    facts: ['622: the Hijra, year one of the Islamic calendar.', '762: Baghdad founded by the Abbasids.'],
    watch: ['Swapping Mecca and Medina: born in Mecca, moved to Medina.', 'Calling the numerals Arabic only: they started in India.'],
    tip: 'Think of the order: Muhammad’s life in Arabia first, then the caliphs who ruled after him. Which part is the question about?',
  },
  'The Vikings': {
    idea: '<p>The <b>Vikings</b> were seafarers from <b>Scandinavia</b> (Norway, Denmark, Sweden). Their raid on the monastery of <b>Lindisfarne</b> in <b>793</b> is the usual start of the Viking Age. Light <b>longships</b> let them cross seas and row far up rivers.</p><p>They raided, but they also traded and settled: in England, Ireland, Iceland and Greenland, and in <b>911</b> the French king gave the leader <b>Rollo</b> land that became <b>Normandy</b>. Around 1000, <b>Leif Erikson</b> reached North America.</p>',
    how: ['Start from where they came from: Scandinavia.', 'Remember the first famous raid (Lindisfarne, 793) and the land they were given (Normandy, 911).', 'Link Normandy to the Normans: Vikings’ descendants, who will conquer England in 1066.'],
    facts: ['793: the raid on Lindisfarne.', '911: Rollo gets Normandy.', 'About 1000: Leif Erikson in North America.'],
    watch: ['Thinking Vikings only raided: many were traders and farmers who settled.', 'Mixing up Leif Erikson with his father Erik the Red, who settled Greenland.'],
    tip: 'Picture the Vikings on their ships: where they set out from, where they raided, where they settled, and how far they sailed.',
  },
  'Feudalism and the manor': {
    idea: '<p>With no strong central government, land was the way to pay for protection. In <b>feudalism</b> the <b>king</b> granted land, a <b>fief</b>, to great lords; they granted land to <b>knights</b>; each <b>vassal</b> promised loyalty and service, usually fighting, in return.</p><p>Most people were <b>peasants</b>, many of them <b>serfs</b> tied to a lord’s <b>manor</b>: his house, the village, fields, mill and church. Serfs worked his land as well as their own strips and could not leave without permission. A noble boy trained as a <b>page</b>, then a <b>squire</b>, and lived by the code of <b>chivalry</b> once knighted.</p>',
    how: ['Picture the pyramid: king, lords (barons), knights, peasants.', 'Read each word as a deal: land and protection go down, loyalty and service go up.', 'Tell the people apart: a vassal holds land from a lord; a serf is a peasant tied to the land.'],
    facts: ['Fief: land granted for service.', 'Vassal: someone who holds land from a lord.', 'Serf: a peasant bound to the manor.', 'Page, squire, knight: a knight’s training.'],
    watch: ['Calling serfs slaves: they couldn’t leave, but had their own strips, homes and rights.', 'Mixing up the knight’s training (page, squire) with a craft guild’s (apprentice, journeyman).'],
    tip: 'Think of feudalism as a chain of deals: who gives land, and who owes what for it?',
  },
  'The medieval Church': {
    idea: '<p>The <b>Church</b> was the strongest power in medieval Europe, in every village and at every king’s court. People paid it a <b>tithe</b>, a tenth of what they produced, and the threat of <b>excommunication</b>, being cut off from the Church, could bring down even rulers. <b>Monks</b> in monasteries prayed, worked and copied books, keeping learning alive.</p><p>In <b>1054</b> the <b>Great Schism</b> split the Church into the <b>Roman Catholic</b> west and the <b>Eastern Orthodox</b> east. In the <b>Investiture Controversy</b>, Pope Gregory VII and Emperor Henry IV fought over who appointed bishops; in <b>1077</b> Henry waited in the snow at <b>Canossa</b> to be forgiven.</p>',
    how: ['Know the Church’s powers: the tithe (money) and excommunication (the threat).', 'Remember the split: 1054, Catholic west and Orthodox east.', 'Remember the quarrel: popes against kings over bishops, and Canossa (1077).'],
    facts: ['1054: the Great Schism.', '1077: Henry IV at Canossa.', 'Tithe: one tenth.'],
    watch: ['Mixing up the Great Schism (1054) with the Protestant Reformation, which came much later (1517).', 'Thinking investiture was about money: it was about appointing bishops.'],
    tip: 'Ask what the question is about: the Church’s hold over ordinary people, its split between east and west, or its fight with kings.',
  },
  'The Norman Conquest': {
    idea: '<p>When Edward the Confessor died childless in 1066, three men claimed England. King <b>Harold II</b> beat a Norwegian invasion at Stamford Bridge, then marched south, and was killed at the <b>Battle of Hastings</b> (<b>1066</b>) by <b>William, Duke of Normandy</b>, “the Conqueror”.</p><p>The Normans held England with <b>castles</b>, first quick motte-and-bailey ones, and gave out land to Norman lords. In <b>1086</b> William had the country surveyed in the <b>Domesday Book</b>. The <b>Bayeux Tapestry</b> tells the story in embroidery.</p>',
    how: ['Remember the winner and the loser at Hastings: William won, Harold died.', 'Twenty years later: the Domesday Book, a survey for taxes.', 'Link the Normans back to the Vikings of Normandy (911).'],
    facts: ['1066: the Battle of Hastings.', '1086: the Domesday Book.'],
    watch: ['Swapping the two: Harold was the English king, William the Norman duke.', 'Thinking the Domesday Book was about the end of the world: it was a survey of land and property.'],
    tip: 'Think of the story in order: a disputed crown, one battle, then how the winner held the country.',
  },
  'The Crusades': {
    idea: '<p>In <b>1095</b> <b>Pope Urban II</b> called on Christians to win back Jerusalem and help the Byzantines. The <b>First Crusade</b> took <b>Jerusalem</b> in <b>1099</b> and set up crusader states. <b>Saladin</b> retook Jerusalem in <b>1187</b>, and <b>Richard the Lionheart</b> led the <b>Third Crusade</b> against him without taking it back.</p><p>The <b>Fourth Crusade</b> never reached the Holy Land: in <b>1204</b> it sacked <b>Constantinople</b>, a Christian city. The Crusades failed in the end, but they brought more <b>trade</b>, spices, silk and ideas from the east into Europe.</p>',
    how: ['Number the crusades: First (1095–1099, took Jerusalem), Third (Richard against Saladin), Fourth (sacked Constantinople, 1204).', 'Know the two sides’ heroes: Richard the Lionheart and Saladin.', 'For results, think trade and contact, not lasting conquest.'],
    facts: ['1095: Urban II calls the First Crusade.', '1099: crusaders take Jerusalem.', '1187: Saladin retakes it.', '1204: the Fourth Crusade sacks Constantinople.'],
    watch: ['Thinking the crusaders kept Jerusalem: they held it 88 years.', 'Forgetting that the Fourth Crusade attacked fellow Christians.'],
    tip: 'Work out which crusade it is first: each one had its own leaders, target and result.',
  },
  'Magna Carta and the power of kings': {
    idea: '<p><b>King John</b> of England lost wars in France and taxed his nobles hard. In <b>1215</b> his <b>barons</b> rebelled and made him seal <b>Magna Carta</b> (“the Great Charter”) at <b>Runnymede</b>. Its big idea: <b>even the king must obey the law</b>, and no free man could be punished except by the law of the land.</p><p>Kings still needed money, so they called nobles, churchmen and townspeople to agree to taxes. These meetings grew into <b>Parliament</b>; <b>Edward I</b>’s <b>Model Parliament</b> of <b>1295</b> is a famous early one.</p>',
    how: ['Name the people: King John, forced by his barons.', 'Say the idea in five words: the king is under the law.', 'Follow it on: asking for taxes led to Parliament (1295).'],
    facts: ['1215: Magna Carta, at Runnymede.', '1295: the Model Parliament.'],
    watch: ['Thinking Magna Carta gave everyone rights or the vote: it protected mostly barons and free men at first.', 'Mixing up King John with his brother Richard the Lionheart, who came before him.'],
    tip: 'Ask who was limiting whom, and why kings kept needing their nobles’ help.',
  },
  'Towns, guilds and learning': {
    idea: '<p>From about 1000, better farming meant more food and more people, and <b>towns</b> grew again around trade. Merchants and craftsmen formed <b>guilds</b>, which set prices and quality and trained new members: an <b>apprentice</b> became a <b>journeyman</b>, and could become a <b>master</b> by making a masterpiece.</p><p>Learning moved from monasteries to <b>universities</b>, starting with <b>Bologna</b> (<b>1088</b>), then Paris and Oxford. <b>Thomas Aquinas</b> joined faith with Aristotle’s reason. Towns raised huge <b>Gothic</b> cathedrals like <b>Notre-Dame</b> (begun <b>1163</b>), with pointed arches, flying buttresses and stained glass.</p>',
    how: ['For guilds, remember the three steps: apprentice, journeyman, master.', 'For buildings, look for the signs of Gothic: pointed arches, flying buttresses, big windows.', 'For learning, think universities (Bologna first) and Thomas Aquinas.'],
    facts: ['1088: University of Bologna.', '1163: work begins on Notre-Dame.'],
    watch: ['Mixing Gothic (pointed arches, light) with Romanesque (round arches, thick walls, earlier).', 'Mixing the guild steps with a knight’s (page, squire, knight).'],
    tip: 'Think of a medieval town: its guilds, its university, and its great cathedral. Which one is the question about?',
  },
  'The Black Death': {
    idea: '<p>In <b>1347</b> the plague reached Europe on ships from the Black Sea. Spread by <b>fleas on rats</b>, and person to person, the <b>Black Death</b> killed perhaps <b>a third or more</b> of Europe’s people by about 1351.</p><p>With so many dead, <b>workers were scarce</b>, so survivors could ask for higher wages and more freedom. Lords and kings tried to hold wages down; in England that, and a new <b>poll tax</b>, set off the <b>Peasants’ Revolt</b> of <b>1381</b>, led by <b>Wat Tyler</b>. Serfdom slowly faded afterwards.</p>',
    how: ['Remember the numbers: 1347 it arrives, about a third of people die.', 'Follow cause and effect: fewer workers, so higher wages, so laws against them, so revolt (1381).', 'Name the leader of the revolt: Wat Tyler.'],
    facts: ['1347: the Black Death reaches Europe.', '1381: the Peasants’ Revolt.'],
    watch: ['Thinking wages fell after the plague: they rose, because workers were scarce.', 'Mixing Wat Tyler with Joan of Arc or Robin Hood.'],
    tip: 'Follow the chain: the plague, then too few workers, then what happened to wages and the fight over them.',
  },
  'The Hundred Years’ War': {
    idea: '<p>English kings claimed the throne of France, and from <b>1337</b> to <b>1453</b> (116 years, with long truces) <b>England and France</b> fought on French soil. English <b>longbowmen</b> won great victories at Crécy and at <b>Agincourt</b> (<b>1415</b>), under <b>Henry V</b>.</p><p>Then a peasant girl, <b>Joan of Arc</b>, inspired the French to lift the siege of <b>Orléans</b> in <b>1429</b>.

  },
  'The end of the Middle Ages': {
    idea: '<p>Several changes around 1450–1500 mark the end of the Middle Ages. In <b>1453</b> the <b>Ottoman Turks</b> under <b>Mehmed II</b> took <b>Constantinople</b> with cannon, ending the Byzantine Empire, and the Hundred Years’ War ended the same year. Around <b>1450</b> <b>Johannes Gutenberg</b>’s <b>printing press</b> made books cheap and ideas fast to spread.</p><p>In <b>1492</b> <b>Granada</b> fell, ending the <b>Reconquista</b> in Spain (and Columbus sailed the same year).

  },
  'The wider medieval world': {
    idea: '<p>Europe was only one part of the medieval world. <b>Song China</b> (960–1279) had paper money, movable type and the compass at sea. <b>Genghis Khan</b> united the Mongols in <b>1206</b>, and his grandson <b>Kublai Khan</b> ruled China, where <b>Marco Polo</b> met him.</p><p>In Japan, from <b>1192</b> the <b>shogun</b> held real power with his <b>samurai</b>, while the emperor reigned in name.
