// Fluentio's settings: the colors, the look, the motion, and the words on the pages.
//
// Two ways to change them:
// On the site, Settings (the button at the top right) shows each change as you make it, but keeps it in that browser
// only. Its "Copy as settings.js" gives you a whole new version of this file.
// Here, for every device: open this file on the space branch, press the pencil, change a value (or paste that copy over
// everything), then press Commit changes. The whole site follows a minute or two later.
//
// Colors can be any CSS color: '#2f6fed', 'tomato', 'rgb(47 111 237)'. Keep the quotes and the commas.
// If something here has a typo, the site keeps working with its usual look.
